Dear users! I want to inform you that, at this stage, the TimeLordLegacy mod is not playable. Changes in the game libraries of M&B during updates have been made that prevent its support in the previous mode. I am not the author of the mod; consequently, other programmers developed the mechanics and logic of the modification for a different version of the game. Therefore, to fix current bugs, such as incorrect display of game time, etc., I need to familiarize myself and understand the game libraries, MCM libraries, and completely review/rewrite the logic of the current modification. Unfortunately, I cannot engage in this process every day, as I am busy creating my own project for a job opportunity. So, at the moment, I DO NOT RECOMMEND using TimeLordLegacy in your playthroughs. I made an update for version 1.2.8, but it does not work as intended, and there is no point in publishing it. After I achieve satisfactory performance of the modification, the version will be updated and available to everyone interested. Thank you for understanding.
